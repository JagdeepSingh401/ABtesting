# ABtesting
Practical Statistics- AB testing on the effects of a new page design compared with the old page. 
The data was about vistors to a website and I was tasked to find a answer to wether the new page layout had any effect on "converting" vistors to buy products from the website. 

The data was gathered and assesed and then cleaned to reduce errors. A Null hypothesis was used to compare the rate of converstions for people who landed on the old page and those who landed one the new page. Probabilities for how likely visitor wold be to be converted where worked out and the differnce plotted on graphs. Other external facotrs were also looked at to see if they effected the rate of converstion for example the counrty of the visitor. 

After the testing was done to a satisfactory level a conclusion was reached.
